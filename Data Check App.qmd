## 1. Program overview background (steal from Chris)

-   what is an interlab?
-   why does it matter?
-   QAQC SOP

## 2. Workflow for each round (JH)

-   collect samples
-   collect lab results
-   compare lab results (use exams distribution as example)
-   PROBLEM: lab results are not comparable if they are inconsistent or missing data or lack QAQC
-   we clean them

## 3. Ease of use and efficiency (JH)

-   but the cleaning is cumbersome and easy to miss steps (x 20 labs)
-   (tidy house points below) - SOP, ...., -app
-   separation from base code have all the issues flagged through the app screening before we generate reports (workflow diagram)

## 4. Establishing the collaboration 

-   Use **GitHub** for version control to enable simultaneous coding by the team.

-   Set multiple branches for difference usage

    **db** - code connect with database (postgres)

    **web** - code render without database connection **(current display version)**

-   Use **Issues** to handling features requests

## 5. App results

**Demo steps**

steps - upload, "public" checks, "internal" drill down checks, submittal (update database)![](img/steps.gif){width="811"}

## 5.1 Main Features

1.  Use **visual plot** to pick out specifically which points are wrong instead of looking or filtering in excel sheet

2.  Use **Tabular summary** of checks to provide an overview according to the SOP.

## 5.2 Solved Challenges

We don't know which method and target the labs will do before we read the file. After add this selection feature we can have quick glance of what the labs do.

-   **Platforms selections**

-   **Targets selections**

## 6. Future developments (JH) - user authentication - migrate to framework which allows for multi-page app - possible integration with "main" registration website
